#### LiteVault

Another possibility is to create a wallet at [LiteVault](https://www.litevault.net/). Please make sure to immediately backup your wallet keys after creating a wallet. We recommend using a password store such as KeePass or 1Password for that.

#### Paper Wallets

For long-term storage of Litecoin you can create a [paper wallet](https://liteaddress.org/). A paper wallet is extremely secure if you guard your private key by storing it in a password vault such as KeePass or LastPass or printing it out and depositing the sheet in a real bank vault.
