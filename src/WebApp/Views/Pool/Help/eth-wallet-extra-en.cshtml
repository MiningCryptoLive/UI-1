#### Paper Wallets

For long-term storage of Ethereum you should create a cold wallet using [MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/) or similar. A paper wallet is extremely secure if you guard your ethereum private key by storing it in a password vault such as KeePass or LastPass or printing it out and depositing the sheet in a real bank vault.
