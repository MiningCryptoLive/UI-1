[MyMonero](https://mymonero.com/) is an uncomplicated method to obtain a monero wallet. Convenience comes with a price of course. Even though this site is run by the creators of Monero, your private keys leave your computer which is a security concern.

#### Paper Wallets

For long-term storage of Monero you should create a cold wallet using [MoneroAddress](https://moneroaddress.org/) or similar. A paper wallet is extremely secure if you guard your private key by storing it in a password vault such as KeePass or LastPass or printing it out and depositing the sheet in a real bank vault.
